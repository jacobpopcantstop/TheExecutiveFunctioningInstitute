      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2026-02-15</p>
      <p>The Executive Function Institute (EFI) collects only the information required to deliver education resources, certification services, and support operations.</p>
      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Account and profile data you submit (name, email, role, program activity).</li>
        <li>Learning and progress data (module completions, assessment outputs, submission metadata).</li>
        <li>Commerce and credential data (orders, certificate verification IDs, fulfillment status).</li>
        <li>Technical usage and diagnostics (page events, referrer path, browser error telemetry).</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How payments and identity are handled</h2>
      <p>Payment processing is handled by our payment processor and is verified server-side before fulfillment. EFI does not store full payment card numbers.</p>
      <p>Authentication and authorization are managed through server-backed identity and session controls. Permissions and role checks are not trusted from browser-only state.</p>
      <h2>Cookies and tracking</h2>
      <p>EFI uses essential cookies/local storage for session continuity and product functionality. If non-essential analytics or marketing cookies are enabled in production, a consent banner and opt-out controls are provided.</p>
      <h2>Data sharing</h2>
      <p>EFI may forward consented lead or event data to configured CRM/ESP providers to deliver requested resources and communications. We do not sell personal data.</p>
      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>For privacy requests, email EFI support through the contact channel listed on this site.</p>
