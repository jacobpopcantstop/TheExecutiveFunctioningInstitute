EFI Capstone Transparency Rubric (Sample)
Version: 2026-02-16

Purpose
This sample rubric demonstrates how EFI distinguishes Passing versus Needs Revision outcomes in capstone review. It is a transparency artifact and does not replace full reviewer scoring sheets.

Component 1: Intake Simulation

Domain: Rapport Building
Passing Standard:
- Uses primarily open-ended prompts and reflective listening.
- Validates client frustration without judgment.
- Maintains collaborative tone and role clarity.
Needs Revision:
- Uses primarily directive advice or closed questions.
- Dismisses client affect and jumps to fixing.
- Communicates in deficit-focused language.

Domain: EF Explanation (Psychoeducation)
Passing Standard:
- Explains EF with accessible, non-clinical language.
- Uses process framing (for example, air-traffic-control metaphor).
- Preserves strengths-based tone.
Needs Revision:
- Uses dense jargon without translation.
- Frames EF problems as character deficits.
- Omits practical behavior translation.

Component 2: Intervention Plan

Domain: Theoretical Grounding
Passing Standard:
- Intervention choices map explicitly to Barkley, Brown, Ward, or Dawson/Guare concepts.
- Rationale links each tactic to a documented EF mechanism.
Needs Revision:
- Suggestions are generic or motivational only.
- No model-to-intervention rationale is provided.

Domain: Environmental Modification
Passing Standard:
- Includes concrete external supports before relying on willpower.
- Includes implementation details at point-of-performance.
Needs Revision:
- Relies on internal effort alone.
- Lacks operational environmental changes.

Interpretation Notes
- A passing result requires acceptable performance across all required domains.
- High-variance or borderline submissions may be escalated to manual audit.
- Final release follows EFI feedback release workflow.
