1. Add server-side purchase enforcement for certificate products
- Block `certificate` and `certificate-frame` in checkout/webhook unless all 6 modules and capstone are passed in server records.

- Remove page-specific nav drift and generate from a single shared partial/template or JS config.

3. Add section-level citation footnotes in long modules
- Add compact "evidence note" blocks tied to claims in each major section, not just page-level source lists.

4. Implement parent-focused intervention toolkit page

5. Implement educator implementation kit page
- Add classroom templates: assignment chunking, transition scripts, and executive-skill observation rubric.

6. Add outcome dashboard metrics for learners
- Show completion trend, average score by domain, and release countdown for pending feedback.

7. Introduce conversion-safe CTA governance
- Define one primary CTA and one secondary CTA per page via utility script to prevent CTA over-saturation.

8. Add structured FAQ schema on curriculum and certification pages
- Target high-intent questions (eligibility, scoring, timelines, refund) for richer search snippets.

9. Improve store trust layer
- Add service comparison table, delivery timelines, refund summary, and purchase prerequisite badges.

10. Add broken-link reporting UX
