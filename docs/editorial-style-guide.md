# Editorial Style Guide (Web Copy)

This guide keeps EFI copy clear, accurate, and credible.

## Voice
- Use direct, plain language.
- Prefer concrete outcomes over hype.
- State limits and requirements explicitly.
- Keep claims evidence-linked where possible.

## Avoid These Phrases
- `transform lives`
- `begin your journey`
- `ready to transform`
- `world-class`
- `game-changer` / `game changer`
- `cutting-edge`
- `holistic approach`
- `seamless experience`
- `next level`
- `unlock the paid track`
- `unlock graded assignments`

## Preferred Replacements
- `transform lives` -> `deliver measurable coaching outcomes`
- `begin your journey` -> `start the program`
- `world-class` -> `evidence-based`
- `game-changer` -> `high-impact in practice`
- `cutting-edge` -> `current`
- `holistic approach` -> `integrated model`
- `seamless experience` -> `clear workflow`
- `unlock ...` -> `includes ...` / `provides access to ...`

## Rule of Thumb
- If a sentence could apply to any coaching website, rewrite it with specifics:
  - what the learner gets,
  - what they must complete,
  - how progress is measured.
