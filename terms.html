      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>These terms govern use of the Executive Function Institute (EFI) website, assessments, certification services, and coaching offers.</p>

      <h2>Service Scope</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>EFI provides educational and coaching-related services, not medical, legal, or crisis intervention services.</li>
        <li>Coaching is not therapy. Users are responsible for seeking licensed clinical care when needed.</li>
        <li>Do not upload protected clinical records or third-party confidential data without authorization.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Program Delivery Model</h2>
      <p>EFI certification delivery is asynchronous. EFI does not advertise required synchronous classes, required live lectures, or required group projects as part of core completion.</p>

      <h2>Certification and Review</h2>
      <p>Certification decisions are based on published rubric criteria and EFI quality-control workflows. EFI may delay release of feedback/results to support review integrity.</p>

      <h2>Payments, Refunds, and Fulfillment</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Paid services are fulfilled only after server-side payment verification.</li>
        <li>Digital access services (assessment reports, grading, certification workflows) are generally non-refundable once delivered.</li>
        <li>Physical fulfillment items may be eligible for replacement if damaged in transit; report fulfillment issues within 14 days of delivery.</li>
        <li>Unauthorized chargebacks or abuse of access controls may result in account suspension pending review.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Marketing and Earnings Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>Examples, calculators, and planning tools are illustrative and do not guarantee income, client volume, or business outcomes.</p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>EFI provides services on an "as available" basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law, EFI is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from service use.</p>
