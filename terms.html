      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>These terms govern your use of the Executive Function Institute (EFI) website, assessments, certification services, and coaching offerings.</p>
      <h2>Use limitations</h2>
      <ul class="checklist"><li>No medical, legal, or crisis services are provided.</li><li>Do not upload protected clinical records or sensitive third-party data without authorization.</li><li>You are responsible for accurate account, enrollment, and submission information.</li></ul>
      <h2>Certification and payment</h2>
      <p>Educational content remains freely accessible. Paid services include graded assessments, certification review, credential operations, alumni network access, and coaching sessions.</p>
      <p>Purchases are subject to server-side verification prior to credential issuance, fulfillment, or premium access unlocks.</p>
      <h2>Asynchronous model</h2>
      <p>EFI certification delivery is asynchronous. There are no required synchronous classes, group projects, or mandatory live lecture attendance.</p>
      <h2>Scope and referrals</h2>
      <p>Coaching is not therapy. EFI reserves the right to pause or deny services when client needs fall outside coaching scope and require licensed clinical or emergency support.</p>
