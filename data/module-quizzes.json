          ],
          "correct": 3,
          "explanation": "Barkley identifies four primary executive functions: inhibition, working memory, emotional regulation, and reconstitution. While time perception is important in EF coaching, it is not one of his core primary functions."

          ],
          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "Temporal horizon is the psychological distance at which future consequences become 'real' and motivating to behavior. People with EF deficits often have a contracted temporal horizon, making long-term planning difficult."

          "correct": 0,
          "explanation": "Verbal working memory and language-based reasoning mature later than other executive functions, often not fully developing until the mid-20s. This is why executive function deficits are sometimes more apparent in adolescence and young adulthood."

          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "Understanding that EF deficits are rooted in neurobiology helps clients understand they are not lazy or unmotivated, but rather dealing with a brain-based challenge. This shifts the narrative and reduces internalized shame, which is essential for therapeutic change."

          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "Time blindness in the context of EF is not literal inability to tell time, but rather difficulty holding future consequences in mind. It affects planning, deadline management, and understanding how long tasks take."

          "correct": 1,
