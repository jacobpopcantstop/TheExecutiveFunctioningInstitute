# The Executive Function Institute

An open-source, science-based Executive Function Coaching Certification program grounded in the work of Barkley, Brown, Dawson & Guare, and Ward.

## About

The Executive Function Institute provides a rigorous six-module certification curriculum that trains professionals to become Certified Executive Function Coaches (CEFC). The program bridges the gap between theoretical neuroscience and practical coaching, training coaches to be the "external frontal lobe" their clients need.
